    - Use fresh lime juice: Fresh lime juice is essential for a tasty Cosmopolitan. Avoid using bottled lime juice which has a completely different flavor. Squeeze the lime yourself for best results.

    - Use quality ingredients: Using good quality vodka, triple sec, and cranberry juice will make a noticeable difference in the final taste of your Cosmopolitan. Opt for a high-quality vodka that is smooth and clean, and choose a 100% cranberry juice with no added sugar.

    - Strain and garnish: After shaking, pour the mix through a strainer to remove any ice chips. This will ensure the drink is silky smooth. Finally, garnish with a twist of lime peel or a slice of lime to add a little extra flavor and visual appeal to your drink.

    ice and top it off with sparkling water or soda. Garnish with a lime wedge and

  tips: |-
    - Use fresh mint: Ensure you have fresh mint leaves and not dried ones. This will give your mint julep an aromatic and fresh flavor.

    - Use the right bourbon: While you may be tempted to use any bourbon, ensure you use a high-quality bourbon with at least 90 proof. Remember, the bourbon makes up the bulk of the cocktail, so using a high-quality one will enhance the taste.

    - Don't over muddle: When muddling the mint, don't overdo it. Simply press the mint gently to release the oils without crushing it too much.

    - Use sugar syrup: In place of granulated sugar, use sugar syrup to sweeten the cocktail. This will ensure that the sugar is completely dissolved, giving the cocktail a smooth taste.

    - Serve it in a chilled glass: Ensure that both the glass and the ice are chilled before serving. This will ensure that your mint julep stays cold for longer.

  tips: "- Use fresh ginger: Grate and muddle fresh ginger for the best flavor in
    your Penicillin. Avoid using ginger powder or pre-made ginger syrup.\n- Shake
    with ice: Vigorously shake your ingredients with ice until the shaker is frosted.
    This will help combine ingredients and give your cocktail a smooth texture.\n-
    Float the float: When adding the Islay Scotch float, carefully pour it on top
    of the cocktail using the back of a spoon. This will help it gently rest on top
    for a beautiful presentation. \n- Garnish with a lemon twist: Cut a small piece
    of lemon peel and twist it over the top of the drink to release the oils. Rub
    the peel around the rim and then drop it into the glass. This will add a bright
    citrus aroma and flavor to the cocktail."
  fun_facts: "1. Penicillin is a whisky-based cocktail that was created by Sam Ross
    in 2005 at the Milk & Honey bar in New York City. \n2. The name \"Penicillin\"

    Alexander Fleming in 1928.\n3. The cocktail is made with two types of Scotch whisky,
    lemon juice, honey-ginger syrup and a float of smoky Islay single malt whisky.\n4.
    Penicillin has been named one of the \"Most Influential Cocktails of the Past
    Century\" by Tales of the Cocktail, a prestigious cocktail festival and conference.\n5.
    Penicillin has spawned numerous variations and spin-offs, including the Mezcal
    Penicillin (which substitutes mezcal for Scotch) and the Bourbon Renewal (which
    substitutes bourbon for Scotch and uses crème de cassis instead of honey-ginger
    syrup)."
  alcohol_free_alternative: An alcohol-free alternative to the drink Penicillin could
    be a blend of fresh ginger juice, honey syrup, and fresh lemon juice topped with
    soda water. This mocktail would have a zesty ginger flavor with a sweet and sour
    kick from the honey and lemon. The soda water would add a sparkling touch that
    mimics the effervescence of the cocktail. To add a smoky element similar to the
    scotch used in the Penicillin, a dash of liquid smoke could be added to the mix.
    This non-alcoholic version would be a refreshing and healthy option that still
    satisfies the taste buds.

  tips: |-
    - Use high-quality coffee beans: The quality of the beans you use will greatly affect the taste of your Ve.n.to drink. Make sure to use freshly roasted, high-quality coffee beans for the best results.

    - Grind the beans correctly: The coffee beans should be ground very finely, like espresso, to create the creamy foam on the top of the Ve.n.to.

    - Use the right amount of water: There are different opinions on how much water to use, but generally a ratio of 1:2 (one part coffee to two parts water) is recommended. Start with 1 shot of espresso (30 ml) and then add 60-90 ml of hot water.

    - Froth the milk properly: The milk should be frothed to the perfect consistency for a Ve.n.to which is creamy and silky, not too foamy or too thin. Use whole milk for the best results.

    - Serve in a clear glass: To showcase the layers of the Ve.n.to - the coffee, the milk, and the foam - always serve it in a clear glass so that you can see the beautiful layers.

  tips: |-
    - Use fresh ingredients: The key to making the perfect casino drink is to use fresh ingredients. Whether it's fresh-squeezed juices or high-quality spirits, fresh ingredients will make a big difference in the taste and quality of your drink.

    - Balance the flavors: A good casino drink should be well-balanced, with just the right amount of sweetness, tartness, and alcohol. Experiment with different ratios until you find the perfect balance for your taste.

    - Use the right glass: The right glass can make all the difference when it comes to presentation and taste. Choose a glass that complements the drink you're making, and make sure it's clean and free of any residue.

    - Add ice at the right time: Adding ice too early can water down your drink, while adding it too late can result in a lukewarm drink. Add ice just before serving to keep your drink at the perfect temperature.

    - Don't forget the garnish: The final touch to any casino drink is the garnish. Whether it's a slice of citrus, a sprig of herbs, or a decorative cocktail pick, a garnish adds visual appeal and can enhance the flavors of your drink.

    3. The name Sazerac comes from the Sazerac de Forge et Fils brand of cognac that was originally used in the recipe.
    4. Sazerac is traditionally served in a glass rinsed with absinthe, which adds an anise flavor and aroma to the drink.
