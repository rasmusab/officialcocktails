<h2 id="tips-for-how-to-make-the-perfect-manhattan">Tips for how to make the perfect Manhattan</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use high-quality liquor: A Manhattan is a simple cocktail made with just a few ingredients, so it&rsquo;s essential to use high-quality bourbon or rye whiskey. Don&rsquo;t skimp on the liquor—it&rsquo;s the star of the show.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose a good vermouth: Vermouth is the other main ingredient in a Manhattan, so it&rsquo;s important to choose a good one. Opt for a dry vermouth that isn&rsquo;t too sweet. The vermouth should enhance the flavor of the whiskey without overpowering it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget the bitters: Bitters are an essential ingredient in a Manhattan, and they add depth and complexity to the cocktail. Use a couple of dashes of aromatic bitters, such as Angostura, to balance the sweetness of the vermouth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take your time when stirring: A Manhattan should be stirred, not shaken, to prevent the drink from becoming too diluted. Stir the cocktail gently for about 30 seconds, being careful not to overdo it. Strain the drink into a chilled glass and enjoy!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="alcohol-free-alternative-to-the-manhattan">Alcohol-free alternative to the Manhattan</h2>
<p>One alcohol-free alternative to the Manhattan cocktail is the &ldquo;Manhattan Mocktail.&rdquo; This mocktail is made with a combination of non-alcoholic ingredients, such as ginger beer, cranberry juice, and cherry syrup, and served with a garnish of maraschino cherries. Another option is the &ldquo;Virgin Manhattan,&rdquo; which is made with non-alcoholic bourbon or whiskey substitutes, such as Seedlip Spice 94 or Ritual Zero Proof Whiskey Alternative, mixed with sweet vermouth and bitters. Both of these alternatives offer a similar taste and experience to the classic Manhattan cocktail without the alcohol.</p>
<h2 id="manhattan-fun-facts">Manhattan fun facts</h2>
<ol>
<li>The Manhattan cocktail was created in the late 1800s in New York City, and it is believed that it was named after the borough of Manhattan.</li>
<li>The classic recipe for a Manhattan includes rye or bourbon whiskey, sweet vermouth, and bitters, but there are many variations and interpretations.</li>
<li>The Manhattan is a popular drink in pop culture and has been featured in movies like &ldquo;The Big Lebowski&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mad Men.&rdquo;</li>
<li>There is a theory that the Manhattan was originally created for a banquet in honor of presidential candidate Samuel Tilden in Manhattan&rsquo;s Manhattan Club, but this has been debunked by historians.</li>
<li>The Manhattan is often served with a cherry, which is a modern addition to the recipe and was not included in the original.</li>
