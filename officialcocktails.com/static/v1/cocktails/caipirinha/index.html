<h2 id="directions-for-how-to-make-the-caipirinha">Directions for how to make the Caipirinha</h2>
<ol>
<li>Cut one lime into small wedges</li>
<li>Place the lime wedges and 4 teaspoons of white cane sugar into a double old fashioned glass</li>
<li>Muddle the lime and sugar gently, until the lime juice is released and the sugar is dissolved</li>
<li>Fill the glass with cracked ice</li>
<li>Add 60 ml of cachaça to the glass</li>
<li>Stir gently to combine all ingredients</li>
<li>Garnish with a lime wedge if desired</li>
<li>Enjoy your homemade Caipirinha!</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="tips-for-how-to-make-the-perfect-caipirinha">Tips for how to make the perfect Caipirinha</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use fresh limes: Squeeze ½ lime into a glass and cut the other half into small pieces to muddle with the sugar.</li>
<li>Use good quality cachaça: The type of cachaça you use will greatly affect the flavor of your cocktail. Aim for a higher quality bottle, and avoid using any that are labeled as industrial cachaça.</li>
<li>Muddle the ingredients well: The sugar and lime need to be muddled really well in order to extract the full flavor. Use a muddler or the back of a spoon to crush the lime and sugar together until the sugar has dissolved.</li>
<li>Add ice and cachaça: Fill the glass with ice, then pour in the cachaça. Give everything a gentle stir, being careful not to over-dilute the drink.</li>
<li>Adjust sweetness: Taste the drink and add more sugar if desired. Keep in mind that some brands of cachaça can be sweeter than others, so adjust accordingly.</li>
<li>Garnish with lime: Cut a slice of lime and place it on top of the drink to add a pop of color and an extra burst of lime flavor. Enjoy!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="alcohol-free-alternative-to-the-caipirinha">Alcohol-free alternative to the Caipirinha</h2>
<p>One alcohol-free alternative to Caipirinha is a mocktail called ‘Virgindade.’ To make this drink, you will need 3/4 cup fresh lime juice, 1/2 cup simple syrup, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, and 1 can of sparkling water. Mix the lime juice, simple syrup, and vanilla extract in a shaker with ice, and shake well. Pour the mixture into a glass filled with ice and top with sparkling water. Garnish with a lime wedge, and enjoy your refreshing Virgindade cocktail.</p>
<h2 id="caipirinha-fun-facts">Caipirinha fun facts</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Caipirinha is the national drink of Brazil and is made by smashing fresh lime wedges with sugar and muddling it with Cachaça, a type of rum made from sugarcane juice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was first created in the early 20th century as a remedy for the Spanish flu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The name &ldquo;Caipirinha&rdquo; comes from the Brazilian word &ldquo;caipira&rdquo;, which means &ldquo;rural&rdquo; or &ldquo;someone from the countryside&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The drink was heavily promoted during the 2014 FIFA World Cup, which was hosted by Brazil, and is now a popular cocktail around the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>September 13th is National Cachaça Day in Brazil, and many people celebrate by enjoying a refreshing glass of Caipirinha.</p>
