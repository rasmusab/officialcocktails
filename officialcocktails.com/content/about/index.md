This is an experiment to try out auto-generating a website using (in 2023) modern AI tools. However, not that all of these drinks really are the Official cocktails of the International Bartenders Association and that the ingredient lists and instructions are correct (as far as Wikipedia is correct). But if stray from the basic instructions and try some of the "how to make the perfect" tips, then don't blame [me](https://www.sumsar.net) when the Pisco Sour goes rancid.
