## Zombie fun facts

3. The name "Zombie" allegedly comes from the fact that after drinking one, you would feel like a zombie - disoriented and stumbling around.
4. The original recipe for the Zombie was lost for many years, but was eventually discovered in a notebook from the 1930s.
5. The Zombie has become a popular drink in tiki culture and is often served in fun, kitschy mugs shaped like skulls or tropical fruits.
