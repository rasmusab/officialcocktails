- Make it cold: Use ice to chill the drink and shake it well until it becomes frosty. 

- Balance the sweetness: Use just the right amount of simple syrup to balance the tartness of the lime juice. 

- Use a strainer: Use a fine-mesh strainer to remove any ice chips or lime pulp for a smooth texture. 

- Serve it straight up: Serve the Daiquiri in a chilled glass without ice to prevent dilution and enjoy the pure flavors.
