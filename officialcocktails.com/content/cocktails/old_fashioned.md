## Tips for how to make the perfect Old fashioned

- **Choose the right whiskey:** The key to a good Old Fashioned is using the right type of whiskey. Bourbon or rye whiskey are the most traditional options, but feel free to experiment with other types of whiskey to find your perfect combination.

- **Don't skimp on the sugar and bitters:** The sugar and bitters are what give the Old Fashioned its signature flavor. Don't be afraid to add a generous amount of each - start with a teaspoon of sugar and a few dashes of bitters, and adjust to your personal taste.

- **Use high-quality ice:** The ice you use in your Old Fashioned can make a big difference in the final product. Use large, clear ice cubes that will melt slowly and not dilute the drink too quickly.

- **Garnish with care:** A simple garnish can take your Old Fashioned to the next level. A classic garnish is a twisted orange peel, but you can also experiment with other fruits, herbs, or spices to add a unique touch to your drink.

## Alcohol-free alternative to the Old fashioned

An alcohol-free alternative to the Old Fashioned could be a "Mocktail Old Fashioned" which includes the following ingredients:

- 2 oz. of orange juice
- 1 oz. of cranberry juice
- 1 tsp. of brown sugar
- 2 dashes of Angostura bitters
- Ice
- Orange peel and maraschino cherries for garnish

To make the mocktail, mix orange juice, cranberry juice, brown sugar, and Angostura bitters in a mixing glass. Stir the mixture until the sugar has dissolved. Add ice and stir again for 20-30 seconds. Strain the mixture into a rocks glass with ice. Garnish the drink with orange peel and maraschino cherries.

This mocktail has similar flavors to the Old Fashioned but without the alcohol content. It's refreshing, fruity and perfect for those who prefer to avoid alcohol.
