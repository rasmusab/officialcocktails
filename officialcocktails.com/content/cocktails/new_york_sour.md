## Tips for how to make the perfect New York sour

- Use a bold and spicy rye whiskey, such as Bulleit Rye or Rittenhouse Rye, for maximum flavor.
- When creating the foam topping, be sure to shake the egg white, lemon juice, and simple syrup vigorously without ice to create a frothy and silky consistency before adding ice and the rest of the ingredients. 
- Float the red wine on top of the foam by gently pouring it over the back of a spoon. This creates a beautiful layered effect and adds a fruity complexity to the drink. 
- Serve the New York Sour in a rocks glass over a large ice cube to keep it chilled without diluting the flavors too quickly. 
- Garnish with a lemon twist and a cherry to complement the citrus and fruit flavors in the drink.

Instead of whiskey, the drink can use black tea to give it a similar depth of flavor. The drink is topped with a splash of cranberry juice, giving it a sweet and sour taste similar to a New York sour.
