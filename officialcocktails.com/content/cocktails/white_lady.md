## Alcohol-free alternative to a White lady

One alcohol-free alternative to the White Lady is the "Virgin Lady." This cocktail can be made by combining 1 ounce of lemon juice, 1 ounce of honey syrup, and 1 ounce of egg white substitute in a cocktail shaker. Shake the mixture vigorously, then add ice to the shaker and shake again. Strain the mixture into a chilled cocktail glass and garnish with a lemon twist or edible flower. This mocktail has a zesty citrus flavor and a frothy texture similar to the White Lady, but without the alcohol content.
