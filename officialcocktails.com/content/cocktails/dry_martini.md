## Directions for how to make a Dry martini

1. Fill a mixing glass with ice cubes.
2. Pour 60 ml (2.0 US fl oz) gin and 10 ml (0.34 US fl oz) dry vermouth into the mixing glass.
3. Stir the mixture well using a cocktail spoon. Stir for approximately 30 seconds to properly chill and dilute the drink.
4. Strain the mixture into a chilled martini cocktail glass.
5. Garnish with a twist of lemon or olive, if desired.

## Tips for how to make the perfect Dry martini

- Use high-quality gin and vermouth for the best flavor. A classic ratio is 2:1 gin to vermouth, but adjust to taste.
- Stir the ingredients with ice for at least 30 seconds for proper dilution and chill. Strain into a chilled martini glass and garnish with a lemon twist or olives.
- For a drier martini, use less vermouth or rinse the glass with it and discard before adding the gin. For a wetter martini, use more vermouth or add a splash of olive juice.
- Experiment with different types of gin and vermouth to find your perfect combination. And remember, always drink responsibly.

## Alcohol-free alternative to a Dry martini

An alcohol-free alternative to the classic Dry Martini could be a mocktail version made with non-alcoholic gin or vodka, vermouth, a dash of olive brine, and a olive or lemon twist garnish. Another option could be a combination of flavored sparkling water, a splash of citrus juice, and a few dashes of bitters, served in a chilled martini glass. This refreshing drink can be enjoyed as a sophisticated and elegant alternative to the classic cocktail, without the effects of alcohol.

## Dry martini fun facts

1. The dry martini is typically made with gin and dry vermouth, but vodka can also be used instead of gin.
2. The martini's origins can be traced back to the mid- to late-1800s, with the first mention of a "martinez" cocktail in print in 1884.
3. The iconic garnish of a martini is a green olive, but some variations can include a lemon twist or cocktail onion.
4. The ratio of gin/vermouth in a dry martini can vary based on personal preference, with some preferring a "bone dry" martini with just a splash of vermouth and others opting for a 50-50 ratio.
5. The famous line "shaken, not stirred" spoken by James Bond in the 007 series has caused some debate among martini purists, as shaking the drink can alter its texture and dilute it more than stirring.
