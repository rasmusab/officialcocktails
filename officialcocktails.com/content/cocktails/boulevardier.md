## Tips for how to make the perfect Boulevardier

- Use high-quality ingredients: A Boulevardier is made with equal parts bourbon or rye whiskey, sweet vermouth, and Campari. To make the perfect Boulevardier, use top-shelf bourbon or rye whiskey, a high-quality sweet vermouth, and a fresh bottle of Campari.
- Stir it well: The Boulevardier is a stirred drink, not a shaken one, so it's important to stir it well. Add ice to a mixing glass, then pour in the bourbon, sweet vermouth, and Campari. Use a bar spoon to stir the ingredients for 20-30 seconds until well combined and chilled.
- Garnish with a twist: The final touch to a perfect Boulevardier is a twist of orange peel. Hold a piece of orange peel in one hand and a lighter in the other, then hold the peel over the drink and use the flame to gently warm the peel for a few seconds. Twist the peel over the drink to release its oils, then drop it in as a garnish.

## Alcohol-free alternative to the Boulevardier

One possible alcohol-free alternative to a Boulevardier is a "Boulevardier mocktail." To make this drink, mix together:

- 1 oz. fresh-squeezed orange juice
- 1 oz. non-alcoholic Campari substitute (such as Gnista)
- 1 oz. non-alcoholic sweet vermouth (such as Lyre's)
- Dash of bitters (optional)

Stir together with ice and strain into a rocks glass over fresh ice. Garnish with an orange twist or cherry, if desired. This drink has a similar bitter-sweet flavor profile to the original Boulevardier, but without the alcohol content.
