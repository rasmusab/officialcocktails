## Directions for how to make a Penicillin

## Tips for how to make the perfect Penicillin

- Use fresh ginger: Grate and muddle fresh ginger for the best flavor in your Penicillin. Avoid using ginger powder or pre-made ginger syrup.
- Shake with ice: Vigorously shake your ingredients with ice until the shaker is frosted. This will help combine ingredients and give your cocktail a smooth texture.
- Float the float: When adding the Islay Scotch float, carefully pour it on top of the cocktail using the back of a spoon. This will help it gently rest on top for a beautiful presentation. 
- Garnish with a lemon twist: Cut a small piece of lemon peel and twist it over the top of the drink to release the oils. Rub the peel around the rim and then drop it into the glass. This will add a bright citrus aroma and flavor to the cocktail.

## Alcohol-free alternative to a Penicillin

An alcohol-free alternative to the drink Penicillin could be a blend of fresh ginger juice, honey syrup, and fresh lemon juice topped with soda water. This mocktail would have a zesty ginger flavor with a sweet and sour kick from the honey and lemon. The soda water would add a sparkling touch that mimics the effervescence of the cocktail. To add a smoky element similar to the scotch used in the Penicillin, a dash of liquid smoke could be added to the mix. This non-alcoholic version would be a refreshing and healthy option that still satisfies the taste buds.
