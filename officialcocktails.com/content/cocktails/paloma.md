## Tips for how to make the perfect Paloma

- Use fresh grapefruit juice: It's best to use fresh grapefruit juice, as opposed to bottled or canned juice, for a more vibrant and natural flavor.

- Rim the glass with salt: The traditional Paloma is served in a glass rimmed with salt. To do this, moisten the rim of the glass with a lime wedge and dip it into a plate of sea salt.

- Choose the right tequila: Look for a tequila that is 100% agave, as this will ensure a smoother and more flavorful drink. Blanco tequila is traditional for Palomas, but reposado or a√±ejo tequila can add extra depth of flavor.

- Adjust sweetness to taste: Paloma recipes often call for a sweetener like simple syrup or agave nectar. Adjust the amount of sweetener to your taste, depending on how tart or sweet you like your drinks.

- Use carbonated water or club soda: Palomas are typically topped off with carbonated water or club soda. Use a good quality sparkling water to add effervescence and balance out the flavors.
