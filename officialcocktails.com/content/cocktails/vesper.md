## Tips for how to make the perfect Vesper

- Use high quality gin and vodka. The Vesper is a strong drink, so it's important to use spirits that you enjoy drinking on their own.
- Stir the drink for at least 30 seconds with ice to achieve the desired dilution and temperature. Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.
- Use Lillet Blanc as the vermouth. This French aperitif wine adds a slightly sweet and floral flavor to the drink.
- Garnish with a thin slice of lemon peel. Express the oils over the drink by twisting the peel before placing it in the glass.

## Alcohol-free alternative to the Vesper

One alcohol-free alternative to the Vesper cocktail could be a "Vesper mocktail". This refreshing drink can be made by mixing non-alcoholic gin or vodka with some grapefruit juice, lemon juice, and a simple syrup. Garnish it with a slice of grapefruit or lemon, and you have a delicious and tasty beverage that is perfect for those who don't drink alcohol or who want to limit their alcohol intake. The mocktail version of Vesper can provide you with a fruity and tangy flavor that is similar to the original cocktail but without any alcohol content.

## Vesper fun facts

1. The Vesper is a concoction of gin, vodka and Lillet Blanc that was first introduced by Ian Fleming in his 1953 James Bond novel "Casino Royale".

2. The cocktail was named after Vesper Lynd, the fictional character who was James Bond's love interest in "Casino Royale".

3. In the book, James Bond gives explicit instructions to the bartender on how to make his signature drink: "Three measures of Gordon's, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it's ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon peel."

4. The Vesper was not actually a popular drink until it was featured in the 2006 James Bond film "Casino Royale", where it was famously ordered by Daniel Craig's Bond. The exposure in the film led to a resurgence of interest in the cocktail.

5. The original recipe for Kina Lillet was discontinued in the 1980s, which has led to some variation in the recipe for the Vesper. Some bartenders substitute the Kina Lillet with Lillet Blanc or Cocchi Americano to replicate the original flavor.
