## Tips for how to make the perfect Sidecar

- Use quality ingredients: For the perfect Sidecar, use quality ingredients including cognac, triple sec, and fresh lemon juice. Avoid using cheap triple sec as it can make the drink taste artificial.
- Pay attention to ratios: The ideal ratio for a Sidecar is 2:1:1, that is, two parts cognac, one part triple sec, and one part lemon juice. However, feel free to adjust the ratios according to your taste preference.
- Don't forget the sugar rim: Coat the rim of your glass with sugar for an added touch of sweetness and texture. To do this, wet the rim with a lemon wedge and gently dip it into a plate of sugar.
