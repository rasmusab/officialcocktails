## Tips for how to make the perfect Manhattan

- Use high-quality liquor: A Manhattan is a simple cocktail made with just a few ingredients, so it's essential to use high-quality bourbon or rye whiskey. Don't skimp on the liquorâ€”it's the star of the show.

- Choose a good vermouth: Vermouth is the other main ingredient in a Manhattan, so it's important to choose a good one. Opt for a dry vermouth that isn't too sweet. The vermouth should enhance the flavor of the whiskey without overpowering it.

- Don't forget the bitters: Bitters are an essential ingredient in a Manhattan, and they add depth and complexity to the cocktail. Use a couple of dashes of aromatic bitters, such as Angostura, to balance the sweetness of the vermouth.

- Take your time when stirring: A Manhattan should be stirred, not shaken, to prevent the drink from becoming too diluted. Stir the cocktail gently for about 30 seconds, being careful not to overdo it. Strain the drink into a chilled glass and enjoy!

## Alcohol-free alternative to the Manhattan

One alcohol-free alternative to the Manhattan cocktail is the "Manhattan Mocktail." This mocktail is made with a combination of non-alcoholic ingredients, such as ginger beer, cranberry juice, and cherry syrup, and served with a garnish of maraschino cherries. Another option is the "Virgin Manhattan," which is made with non-alcoholic bourbon or whiskey substitutes, such as Seedlip Spice 94 or Ritual Zero Proof Whiskey Alternative, mixed with sweet vermouth and bitters. Both of these alternatives offer a similar taste and experience to the classic Manhattan cocktail without the alcohol.
