## Tips for how to make the perfect Mojito

- Use fresh ingredients: Use fresh mint leaves, lime juice and good quality rum to make the perfect Mojito.
- Muddle properly: Muddle the mint leaves and lime wedges gently so as to extract the essential oils without making the mixture too bitter.
- Use sugar syrup: Use sugar syrup instead of granulated sugar as it dissolves faster and ensures that the sugar is evenly distributed throughout the drink.
- Use carbonated water: Use carbonated water instead of regular tap water to give the drink a refreshing and bubbly finish.
- Garnish with mint and lime wedges: Garnish the Mojito with fresh mint leaves and lime wedges to make it look appealing and add to its flavor.

## Alcohol-free alternative to the Mojito

One alcohol-free alternative to the drink Mojito is a "Virgin Mojito" or "Nojito." To make it, you will need

- 1/2 lime, cut into quarters
- 8-10 fresh mint leaves
- 1/2 oz. simple syrup (sugar water)
- 4 oz. club soda
- Crushed ice

To make the drink, start by muddling the lime and mint leaves in a glass until the lime juice has been extracted and the aroma of mint is released. Add the simple syrup and mix it with the muddled lime and mint. Next, add crushed ice to fill the glass, leaving enough room for the club soda. Finally, top off the glass with club soda and give the drink a good stir. Garnish the drink with a sprig of fresh mint and a lime wedge, and enjoy your refreshing and tangy "Nojito."
