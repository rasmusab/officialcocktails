## Tips for how to make the perfect Aviation

- Use fresh, quality ingredients. A classic Aviation cocktail is made with gin, maraschino liqueur, lemon juice, and crème de violette. Make sure your gin is of good quality and your lemon juice is freshly squeezed. 
- Measure your ingredients carefully. The perfect Aviation drink requires a delicate balance of flavors, so it's important to measure your ingredients with precision. Use a jigger or measuring cup to ensure that you're adding the right amount of each ingredient. 
- Shake vigorously. The Aviation drink should be well-shaken with ice to create a frothy texture and ensure that the flavors meld together. Shake for at least 15 seconds until the drink is ice-cold and the shaker is frosted. 
- Strain carefully. Once you've shaken your Aviation cocktail, strain it through a fine mesh strainer to remove any ice chips or pulp from the lemon juice. This will help give your drink a smooth, velvety texture. 
- Garnish with a cherry. A classic Aviation is traditionally garnished with a Luxardo cherry, which adds a sweet and slightly bitter note to the drink. You can also add a lemon twist for a bit of extra citrus flavor.
