An alcohol-free alternative to the Martinez could be a "Berry Spice" mocktail. 

To make this mocktail, muddle fresh raspberries, blackberries, and cinnamon in a shaker. Add in a splash of ginger syrup and fresh lemon juice to give the mixtures some tanginess. Then, shake everything with ice and strain it into a glass. Top it off with a splash of sparkling water and garnish it with a sprig of rosemary or mint. 

This mocktail has a blend of sweet tartness with a spicy finish, giving you a unique flavor similar to the Martinez. Plus, it's perfect for those looking for a sophisticated non-alcoholic beverage to enjoy all evening.
