## Alcohol-free alternative to the Horse's neck

Horse's neck is a cocktail typically made with brandy and ginger ale, often garnished with a long, thin twist of lemon peel. An alcohol-free alternative to this drink could be a mocktail called the "Stablemate," which includes ginger beer, fresh lemon juice, and honey syrup. 

To make a Stablemate, combine 6 oz of ginger beer in a cocktail shaker with ice. Add 1 oz of fresh lemon juice and 1 oz of honey syrup (which can be made by combining equal parts honey and hot water, and letting it cool). Shake until well mixed and strain into a chilled glass filled with ice. Garnish with a lemon twist or a slice of fresh ginger. 

This refreshing and flavorful mocktail has the same bright citrus and spicy ginger flavors as a Horse's neck, but without the alcohol. It's perfect for anyone looking for a non-alcoholic option that still has lots of character and taste.
