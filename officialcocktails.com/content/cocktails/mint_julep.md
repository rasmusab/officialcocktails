## Tips for how to make the perfect Mint julep

- Use fresh mint: Ensure you have fresh mint leaves and not dried ones. This will give your mint julep an aromatic and fresh flavor.

- Crush the ice: For a perfect mint julep, crushing the ice is important. Use a mallet or your blender to crush the ice until it's small and powdery. This will create a perfect consistency with the cocktail.

- Use the right bourbon: While you may be tempted to use any bourbon, ensure you use a high-quality bourbon with at least 90 proof. Remember, the bourbon makes up the bulk of the cocktail, so using a high-quality one will enhance the taste.

- Don't over muddle: When muddling the mint, don't overdo it. Simply press the mint gently to release the oils without crushing it too much.

- Use sugar syrup: In place of granulated sugar, use sugar syrup to sweeten the cocktail. This will ensure that the sugar is completely dissolved, giving the cocktail a smooth taste.

- Serve it in a chilled glass: Ensure that both the glass and the ice are chilled before serving. This will ensure that your mint julep stays cold for longer.
