## Tips for how to make the perfect Last word

- **Use quality ingredients**: The Last Word cocktail only contains four ingredients, so it's crucial to use high-quality ones to ensure the best taste. Use premium gin, freshly squeezed lime juice, maraschino liqueur, and green Chartreuse.

- **Measure ingredients precisely**: The perfect Last Word cocktail requires precise measurements. Use a jigger or measuring cup to measure each ingredient correctly.

- **Shake well**: To get the perfect frothy and chilled Last Word cocktail, you need to shake the ingredients vigorously. Shake all the ingredients with ice for 10-15 seconds until the shaker is frosty on the outside.

- **Double strain**: Use a fine-mesh strainer to pour the cocktail into a chilled glass. Double straining eliminates any ice chips or pulp, leaving a silky smooth drink.

- **Garnish with a lime twist**: Finish off the cocktail by expressing a lime twist over the drink. This adds an extra layer of citrus aroma and a pop of color.

Pour the mixture over ice, and garnish with a cherry and a sprig of mint. The drink will have a tart, sweet, and slightly herbal flavor, similar to the original cocktail, but without the alcohol content. It's a refreshing and satisfying drink that can be enjoyed without worrying about the next morning's hangover.
