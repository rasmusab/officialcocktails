## Tips for how to make the perfect Vieux Carré

- Use high-quality ingredients: Be sure to use high-quality whiskey, cognac, and sweet vermouth in your Vieux Carré. Using top-shelf ingredients will elevate the flavor of the drink.

- Balance the flavors: The Vieux Carré should have a slightly sweet, slightly bitter, and slightly spicy taste. Be sure to measure the ingredients precisely to achieve the perfect balance of flavors.

- Stir, don't shake: Unlike many other cocktails, the Vieux Carré is traditionally stirred rather than shaken. Stirring helps to create a silky texture while preserving the delicate flavors of the ingredients.

- Use a large ice cube: Using a large ice cube will help to slowly dilute the drink without watering it down too quickly. This will preserve the flavors and aromas of the cocktail for a longer period of time.

- Garnish carefully: The Vieux Carré traditionally calls for a lemon twist as a garnish. Be sure to carefully peel the lemon to avoid any bitter pith, and twist the peel over the drink to express its essential oils.
