3. The Negroni has gained a cult following over the years, with entire events (such as Negroni Week) and merchandise (like Negroni-themed clothing and glassware) dedicated to the drink.

4. The Negroni has often been referenced in pop culture, from James Bond ordering one in "Casino Royale" to a scene in the popular TV show "Mad Men" where it's described as "the drink of summer, 1968."

5. The Negroni has inspired a number of spin-off drinks, including the Negroni Sbagliato (which uses prosecco instead of gin) and the Boulevardier (which replaces gin with whiskey).
