## Alcohol-free alternative to a Alexander

An alcohol-free alternative to the Alexander is a mocktail called the "Chocolatini". It is made with a combination of chocolate syrup, vanilla extract, heavy cream or coconut milk, and ice. The ingredients are mixed together in a shaker and strained into a martini glass. Garnish with a sprinkle of cocoa powder or chocolate shavings for an extra touch of decadence. This drink offers the same rich and creamy flavor as the Alexander without the use of alcohol.
