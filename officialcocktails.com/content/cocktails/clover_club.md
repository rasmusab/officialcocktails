## Alcohol-free alternative to a Clover Club

One alcohol-free alternative to the famous cocktail, Clover Club, is a mocktail made with fresh ingredients such as raspberries or strawberries, fresh lime juice, egg white, and simple syrup or honey. This mocktail is a refreshing, tart and mildly sweet drink, and could be served with a garnish of fresh berries or a lime wheel. The addition of the egg white provides extra frothiness to the drink, which resembles the texture of the original Clover Club cocktail. Another non-alcoholic option could be a fruity blend of pomegranate and cranberry juices, mixed with fresh lemon and lime juice and topped with club soda, creating a tangy and bubbly drink. This alternative to Clover Club provides a flavorful and fun way to enjoy a mocktail, without sacrificing taste and creativity.
