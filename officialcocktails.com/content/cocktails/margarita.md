## Alcohol-free alternative to a Margarita

A similar alternative to Margarita that contains no alcohol is a virgin Margarita or a 'mocktail.' This drink is made using the same ingredients as a traditional Margarita but without any liquor. The ingredients typically include fresh lime juice, orange juice, agave syrup or simple syrup, and club soda or sparkling water. The drink is served over ice in a salt-rimmed glass and garnished with a slice of lime. This non-alcoholic drink is perfect for those who want to enjoy the taste of a classic Margarita without the effects of alcohol.
