## Alcohol-free alternative to the Hemingway special

The Hemingway Special is a cocktail made with rum, grapefruit juice, lime juice, and maraschino liqueur. An alcohol-free alternative to this drink could be a mocktail that includes the same fruity and citrusy flavors but omits the rum and maraschino liqueur.

Here's a recipe for an alcohol-free version of the Hemingway Special:

Ingredients:
- 3 oz grapefruit juice
- 1 oz lime juice
- 1 oz simple syrup
- Club soda
- Grapefruit slice for garnish

Instructions:
1. Add grapefruit juice, lime juice, and simple syrup to a shaker filled with ice.
2. Shake well and strain into a glass filled with ice.
3. Top with club soda and stir gently.
4. Garnish with a grapefruit slice.

This mocktail version of the Hemingway Special is refreshing and tangy, with a hint of sweetness from the simple syrup. The club soda adds a bit of fizz and makes the drink feel extra refreshing. It's a perfect alternative for anyone looking for a non-alcoholic option that still has plenty of flavor.
