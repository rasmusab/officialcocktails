## Tips for how to make the perfect Spritz

- Add Aperol or Campari: A Spritz needs either Aperol or Campari to give it the distinct citrus and bittersweet flavor. Add just the right amount according to your taste. 

- Add Soda Water: The final ingredient to the recipe is soda water or sparkling water. Add a splash or two to create the perfect balance of fizz and refreshing taste. 

- Ice and a slice of orange: Top off the drink with some ice and a slice of orange for a beautiful and delicious presentation. Enjoy your perfect Spritz!

This refreshing beverage is made with sparkling water, muddled fruit (such as raspberries, strawberries or citrus), and mixers like simple syrup or elderflower syrup. It can be served in a wine glass or a lowball glass over ice with a slice of fruit for garnish.
