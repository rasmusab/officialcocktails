## Tips for how to make the perfect Champagne cocktail

- Choose the right Champagne: Use dry Champagne for cocktail drinks as it blends well with other flavors. Sweet Champagne can make the drink too sugary.
- Add complementary flavors: Add a splash of cognac for richness or fruit juice for a fresh, zesty taste. A drop of bitters can also add depth to the drink.
- Keep it chilled: Serve the Champagne cocktail in a chilled glass or add ice cubes to keep it cold.
- Use the right glass: Serve Champagne cocktails in a tall, narrow glass called a flute, or a wider glass called a coupe. This allows the Champagne to retain its bubbles and aroma. 
- Garnish with a twist: Finish the cocktail with a twist of lemon or lime, or add berries or mint leaves to complement the flavors.

## Alcohol-free alternative to the Champagne cocktail

An alcohol-free alternative to a Champagne cocktail can be a Sparkling Cider Cocktail, which can provide the same fizzy and celebratory feeling without the alcohol. To make this, one can take a bottle of sparkling apple cider, add a splash of freshly squeezed grapefruit juice, and a few dashes of bitters. This can be poured into a champagne flute and garnished with a slice of apple and a sprig of rosemary for added aroma and visual appeal. The Sparkling Cider cocktail can be a refreshing and delicious drink for all ages and occasions.
