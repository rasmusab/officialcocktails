## Tips for how to make the perfect Bramble

- Use fresh blackberries for muddling and garnishing. Frozen berries can be used as well, but fresh ones add more flavor.
- Make sure to use high-quality gin to give the drink a smooth and balanced taste. Avoid using cheap gin as it can make the drink taste harsh.
- Use a high-quality raspberry liqueur for the best flavor. Chambord is a popular choice, but any good quality raspberry liqueur will do.
- Balance the sweetness of the raspberry liqueur with tart lemon juice. Freshly squeezed lemon juice is best, but bottled lemon juice can be used as well.
- To make the drink extra special, use a homemade blackberry syrup. Simply simmer fresh blackberries with sugar and water to make a sweet and tangy syrup that pairs perfectly with gin and raspberry liqueur.
- Serve the drink over crushed ice and garnish with fresh blackberries and a lemon wedge. Enjoy!
