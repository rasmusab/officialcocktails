## Alcohol-free alternative to a Old Cuban

One alternative to the alcoholic drink Old Cuban could be a non-alcoholic mojito. This drink can be made by muddling fresh mint leaves and lime wedges together in a glass, and then adding ice and topping it off with 7-up or another soda. This drink provides the refreshing taste of mint and lime, without the added alcohol content of the Old Cuban. Another option could be a virgin daiquiri made with fresh fruit juices and blended ice for a frozen, fruity drink without the alcohol. For those who prefer a more sophisticated drink, a virgin Mary Pickford can be made with pineapple juice, grenadine, and soda water, served over ice with a garnish of pineapple and a maraschino cherry. These alcohol-free alternatives are perfect for those who want to enjoy the flavors and experience of a classic cocktail, without the alcohol.
