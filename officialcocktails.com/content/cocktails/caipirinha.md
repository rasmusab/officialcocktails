## Tips for how to make the perfect Caipirinha

- Use fresh limes: Squeeze ½ lime into a glass and cut the other half into small pieces to muddle with the sugar.
- Use good quality cachaça: The type of cachaça you use will greatly affect the flavor of your cocktail. Aim for a higher quality bottle, and avoid using any that are labeled as industrial cachaça.
- Muddle the ingredients well: The sugar and lime need to be muddled really well in order to extract the full flavor. Use a muddler or the back of a spoon to crush the lime and sugar together until the sugar has dissolved.
- Add ice and cachaça: Fill the glass with ice, then pour in the cachaça. Give everything a gentle stir, being careful not to over-dilute the drink.
- Adjust sweetness: Taste the drink and add more sugar if desired. Keep in mind that some brands of cachaça can be sweeter than others, so adjust accordingly.
- Garnish with lime: Cut a slice of lime and place it on top of the drink to add a pop of color and an extra burst of lime flavor. Enjoy!

One alcohol-free alternative to Caipirinha is a mocktail called ‘Virgindade.’ To make this drink, you will need 3/4 cup fresh lime juice, 1/2 cup simple syrup, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, and 1 can of sparkling water. Mix the lime juice, simple syrup, and vanilla extract in a shaker with ice, and shake well. Pour the mixture into a glass filled with ice and top with sparkling water. Garnish with a lime wedge, and enjoy your refreshing Virgindade cocktail.
