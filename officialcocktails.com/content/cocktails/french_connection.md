## Tips for how to make the perfect French Connection

- Chill all the ingredients before making the cocktail. This will ensure the drink is cold and refreshing.

- Use a good-quality cognac and amaretto to make the French Connection. These two ingredients are the backbone of the drink, so it’s important to use the best you can find.

- Stir the cocktail gently to combine the ingredients. Over-stirring can dilute the drink and ruin the balance of flavors.

- Serve the French Connection in a chilled glass with a large ice cube. This will help to keep the drink cold without watering it down too quickly.

- Garnish the cocktail with a twist of orange peel to add a bright citrus flavor to the drink. Simply twist a small piece of orange peel over the top of the cocktail and drop it into the glass.

## Alcohol-free alternative to the French Connection

One alcohol-free alternative to the French Connection could be the "French Berry Delight". This drink can be made by mixing 2 parts cranberry juice, 1 part raspberry syrup, and 1 part orange juice. Shake the mixture with ice and strain into a martini or rocks glass. Garnish with a slice of orange or a raspberry and enjoy your fruity and refreshing French Berry Delight.
