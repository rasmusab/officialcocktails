- If you want your gin fizz to have a smooth texture, add an egg white to your cocktail shaker before shaking.

- Use plenty of ice to create a refreshing and chilled cocktail. 

- Before pouring the gin fizz into the glass, measure it against a jigger to ensure that you have the right proportions.

- Garnish with a lemon twist or a slice of lemon for a decorative and zesty finish.
