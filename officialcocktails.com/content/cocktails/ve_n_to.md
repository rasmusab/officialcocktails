## Tips for how to make the perfect Ve.n.to

- Use high-quality coffee beans: The quality of the beans you use will greatly affect the taste of your Ve.n.to drink. Make sure to use freshly roasted, high-quality coffee beans for the best results.

- Grind the beans correctly: The coffee beans should be ground very finely, like espresso, to create the creamy foam on the top of the Ve.n.to.

- Use the right amount of water: There are different opinions on how much water to use, but generally a ratio of 1:2 (one part coffee to two parts water) is recommended. Start with 1 shot of espresso (30 ml) and then add 60-90 ml of hot water.

- Froth the milk properly: The milk should be frothed to the perfect consistency for a Ve.n.to which is creamy and silky, not too foamy or too thin. Use whole milk for the best results.

- Serve in a clear glass: To showcase the layers of the Ve.n.to - the coffee, the milk, and the foam - always serve it in a clear glass so that you can see the beautiful layers.

## Alcohol-free alternative to a Ve.n.to

One great alcohol-free alternative to Ve.n.to is the Virgin Mojito. It contains all the classic ingredients of a traditional mojito, including lime juice, fresh mint, and sugar, but without the added rum.
