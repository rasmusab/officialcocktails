## Tips for how to make the perfect Southside

- Use fresh ingredients: The key to a perfect Southside drink is using fresh ingredients. Use fresh mint leaves, lime juice, and good quality gin.

- Don't skimp on the mint: Mint is the star ingredient in a Southside drink, so don't be afraid to use a lot of it. Muddle several sprigs of mint in the bottom of your cocktail shaker before adding the other ingredients.

- Balance the sweet and sour: A great Southside drink is a balance between sweet and sour. Use simple syrup or sugar to sweeten the drink and fresh lime juice for the sour component.

- Shake, shake, shake: Make sure to shake the drink well to ensure that all the flavors are fully mixed and the drink is ice cold.

- Don't forget the garnish: A sprig of fresh mint and a lime wedge are classic garnishes for a Southside drink. Not only do they look great, but they also add extra flavor to the drink.

- Serve in a chilled glass: Serve the drink in a chilled glass to keep it cold and refreshing. A coupe or martini glass works well for a Southside drink.
