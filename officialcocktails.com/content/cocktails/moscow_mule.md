## Tips for how to make the perfect Moscow mule

-  Use a high-quality vodka: The vodka is the star of the Moscow mule, so make sure you use a high-quality vodka that you would enjoy on its own.

- Use freshly squeezed lime juice: Avoid using pre-made lime juice as they often contain artificial flavors and preservatives. Squeeze fresh lime juice for the best taste.

- Use ginger beer: Ginger beer is the key to a great Moscow mule. It's important to choose a good quality ginger beer that is not too sweet, and has a sharp ginger flavor.

- Use a copper mug: A copper mug not only gives the drink a classic look, but it also keeps the drink cold for longer, thanks to the metal's temperature-conducting properties.

- Garnish with fresh mint and a lime wedge: A sprig of fresh mint and a wedge of lime add a pop of color and flavor to your Moscow mule. 

- Don't overdo it on the ice: A few large ice cubes will keep your drink chilled without watering it down too quickly. 

- Remember the ratio: The classic Moscow mule ratio is 2:1:1 (2 parts vodka, 1 part lime juice, 1 part ginger beer). Adjust to your personal taste.

## Alcohol-free alternative to a Moscow mule

An alcohol free alternative to the drink Moscow mule could be a virgin or alcohol-free Moscow mule. This can be made using the same ingredients as the original cocktail with the exception of vodka. Instead of vodka, ginger beer and lime juice are mixed with ice and served in a copper mug for an authentic feel to the drink.
