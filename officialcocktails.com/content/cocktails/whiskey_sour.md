## Tips for how to make the perfect Whiskey sour

- **Use fresh ingredients**: Use freshly squeezed lemon juice instead of bottled lemon juice for a brighter, more authentic flavor. Similarly, use freshly cracked ice instead of pre-made ice cubes for a smoother, better blended drink.

- **Balance the sweet and sour flavors**: A good whiskey sour should be perfectly balanced between sweet and sour flavors. Start by adding equal parts simple syrup and lemon juice, then adjust as needed to suit your personal taste.

- **Choose the right whiskey**: Opt for a bourbon or rye whiskey with a smooth, mellow flavor that won't overpower the other ingredients.

- **Shake it up**: Make sure to shake the whiskey sour well to properly blend the ingredients and create a frothy foam on top.

- **Garnish with style**: A traditional whiskey sour is typically garnished with a lemon wheel and cherry, but feel free to get creative and add your own personal touch with a unique garnish like a sprig of rosemary or a dash of cinnamon.
