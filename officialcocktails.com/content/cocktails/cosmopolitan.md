## Tips for how to make the perfect Cosmopolitan

- Chill all ingredients: The perfect Cosmopolitan drink requires chilled ingredients. Make sure to chill the cranberry juice, vodka, lime juice and triple sec before pouring them into the shaker.

- Shake vigorously: The key to a good Cosmopolitan is to shake vigorously. This will ensure that the ingredients are well mixed, and the drink is properly aerated. Shaking for around 10 to 15 seconds should do the trick.

- Use fresh lime juice: Fresh lime juice is essential for a tasty Cosmopolitan. Avoid using bottled lime juice which has a completely different flavor. Squeeze the lime yourself for best results.

- Use quality ingredients: Using good quality vodka, triple sec, and cranberry juice will make a noticeable difference in the final taste of your Cosmopolitan. Opt for a high-quality vodka that is smooth and clean, and choose a 100% cranberry juice with no added sugar.

- Strain and garnish: After shaking, pour the mix through a strainer to remove any ice chips. This will ensure the drink is silky smooth. Finally, garnish with a twist of lime peel or a slice of lime to add a little extra flavor and visual appeal to your drink.

## Alcohol-free alternative to a Cosmopolitan

A non-alcoholic alternative to Cosmopolitan can be a mocktail called "Cranberry Fizz." To prepare this drink, one would need cranberry juice, sparkling water or soda, and lime juice. To prepare, mix a cup of cranberry juice with 1/4 cup of lime juice in a shaker. Then pour the mixture over a glass with ice and top it off with sparkling water or soda. Garnish with a lime wedge and serve chilled. This drink has a similar taste profile to the Cosmopolitan with the added benefit of being alcohol-free.

## Cosmopolitan fun facts

1. The Cosmopolitan was not originally a pink drink! Its classic recipe calls for vodka, triple sec, lime juice, and cranberry juice, which gives it a pale orange color.
2. Though the drink became widely popular in the 1990s, it was actually created in the 1970s by a bartender named Cheryl Cook in Miami.
3. The drink's name comes from the magazine Cosmopolitan, which was known for its progressive content and appeal to young women. The drink was marketed as a "feminine" and sophisticated choice.
4. In the TV show Sex and the City, the Cosmopolitan became the go-to drink for the main characters during their frequent nights out on the town. This helped to skyrocket its popularity even further.
5. Despite its glamorous reputation, the Cosmopolitan is a fairly low-alcohol drink. The classic recipe contains only about 1.5 oz of vodka, making it a good choice for those who don't like their drinks too strong.
