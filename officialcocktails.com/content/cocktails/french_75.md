## Alcohol-free alternative to a French 75

A non-alcoholic alternative to the French 75 cocktail could be a sparkling lemonade or a citrus mocktail. The bubbly texture of the sparkling beverage replaces the champagne in the original recipe, while the tangy citrus flavors mimic the tartness of the lemon juice.
