## Tips for how to make the perfect Casino

- Use fresh ingredients: The key to making the perfect casino drink is to use fresh ingredients. Whether it's fresh-squeezed juices or high-quality spirits, fresh ingredients will make a big difference in the taste and quality of your drink.

- Balance the flavors: A good casino drink should be well-balanced, with just the right amount of sweetness, tartness, and alcohol. Experiment with different ratios until you find the perfect balance for your taste.

- Use the right glass: The right glass can make all the difference when it comes to presentation and taste. Choose a glass that complements the drink you're making, and make sure it's clean and free of any residue.

- Add ice at the right time: Adding ice too early can water down your drink, while adding it too late can result in a lukewarm drink. Add ice just before serving to keep your drink at the perfect temperature.

- Don't forget the garnish: The final touch to any casino drink is the garnish. Whether it's a slice of citrus, a sprig of herbs, or a decorative cocktail pick, a garnish adds visual appeal and can enhance the flavors of your drink.

## Alcohol-free alternative to a Casino

One possible alcohol-free alternative to the drink Casino is an alcohol-free sangria. Sangria is a refreshing and fruity drink that can be made with a variety of fresh fruits, juices, and spices. To make an alcohol-free version, simply omit the wine and replace it with a non-alcoholic substitute, such as grape juice or sparkling water.

Ingredients:

- 2 cups of grape juice (or another non-alcoholic substitute)
- 1 cup of freshly squeezed orange juice
- 1/2 cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 1/4 cup of honey (or another sweetener of your choice)
- 1 cup of fresh or frozen mixed fruit (such as strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, or peaches)
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 1 cup of sparkling water (or more, to taste)
- Ice cubes

Instructions:

1. In a large pitcher, combine the grape juice, orange juice, lemon juice, and honey. Stir well to dissolve the honey.

2. Add the mixed fruit and cinnamon stick to the pitcher, and stir gently.

3. Place the pitcher in the refrigerator to chill for at least 1 hour, or until the fruit has infused the juice with flavor.

4. Just before serving, add the sparkling water to the pitcher and stir gently.

5. Add ice cubes to individual glasses, and pour the sangria over the ice.

6. Garnish with additional fresh fruit, if desired.

Enjoy your alcohol-free sangria!
